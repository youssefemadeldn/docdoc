  ## Architecture
  
 This project uses Clean Architecture with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to keep the code modular and maintainable. Each layer has a dedicated responsibility:
   1. Model: Defines the data structures and handles logic related to data.
   2. ViewModel: Connects the view and model, handling user inputs and updating the UI accordingly.
   3. View: Responsible for displaying the data and capturing user interactions.
